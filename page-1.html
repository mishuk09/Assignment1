   <h1 style="size: 50px;">Hundreds trapped under bombed Mariupol theatre; Biden urges Xi to abandon Russia Top Points</h1>
   <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202203/UKRAINE_SOLDIER2_0_1200x768.jpeg?4PBC_xuICT8ZhthOdOtJd.4dG5zRI7jv&size=770:433" width="300px">

  <p> Hundreds of civilians are feared trapped under a bombed-out theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol as Russian forces pressed their lethal attacks on Ukrainian cities with shelling and missiles. 
       Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden sought to prevent Beijing from coming to Russia's aid in Ukraine, even as Russian premier Vladimir Putin put on a grand show of strength back home. 
       In more worrying news, diplomatic dialogue between Kyiv and Moscow, which had seemed promising at the outset of the week, hit another deadlock on Friday as both sides accused one another of dragging the talks.</p>
  <p>HERE ARE THE TOP DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR:
       1. A Russian airstrike hit a theatre in the heart of Mariupol, where hundreds of civilians were said to have taken shelter. While 130 survivors have been rescued so far, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said hundreds are still believed trapped under the rubble of the bombed theatre.
   
       2. In capital Kyiv, one person was killed and 19 others wounded when shelling ripped into a residential building in the Podil neighbourhood. Officials said 222 people have been killed in the capital since the start of the war, including 60 civilians and four children.
   
       3. Russian forces fired a barrage of missiles at an aircraft repair facility near Lviv, a city where hundreds of thousands found refuge away from the conflict's frontlines. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said the airstrikes had destroyed several buildings but caused no casualties.

   <p>4. Over a video call, US President Joe Biden reportedly informed his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that Beijing would pay a steep price if it assists Russia's invasion. Xi told Biden that conflicts and confrontations such as the events in Ukraine are in the interests of no one, according to Chinese state media.

      5. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that American officials were evaluating potential war crimes in Ukraine and that if the intentional targeting of civilians by Russia is confirmed, there will be “massive consequences.”
      
      6. Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared at a huge flag-waving rally in Moscow and praised his country's troops. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people attended the event, which marked the eighth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.</p>
