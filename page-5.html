  <p>India at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) said It is important to ensure full and effective implementation Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention (BTWC) amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

      "India attaches high importance to BTWC as a key global and non-discriminatory disarmament convention, prohibiting an entire category of weapons of mass destruction," said R Ravindra, Deputy Permanent Representative (DPR) of India to the United Nations at the UNSC meet.</p>
  <p>"We also believe that any matter relating to obligations under the BTWC should be addressed as per the provisions of the convention and through consultations and cooperation between the parties concerned," he added.

        Meanwhile, India also welcomed the fresh round of talks between Russia and Ukraine to reach a solution to end the war.</p>
 <p>Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a disarmament treaty that effectively bans biological and toxin weapons. Earlier, Russia had claimed that the US was funding “military biological activities” in Ukraine. Both the US and Ukrainian governments have denied the same.

      Russia launched a 'special military operation' in Ukraine on February 24 and has been launching strikes across the country ever since, triggering a massive refugee crisis and leading to the death of several hundred civilians.</p>
