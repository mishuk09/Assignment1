<p>Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad arrived at 10, Janpath on Friday to meet party president Sonia Gandhi amid talks of rapprochement between the dissenting Group of 23 (G-23) faction and party high command.

       Earlier this week, Sonia Gandhi reportedly spoke twice on the phone to Ghulam Nabi Azad, even as the G-23 held back-to-back meetings to discuss an overhaul of the party organisation after the recent poll debacle in five states.</p>
<p>"As far leadership is concerned, it was already decided in the CWC that Mrs Sonia Gandhi should continue. Leadership isnâ€™t the issue, nobody has said that Mrs Gandhi should quit. We just had some suggestions that were shared," Azad told India Today.

       He said that Sonia Gandhi had offered to resign from the post of interim president during the CWC meeting, but everyone had unanimously asked her to stay on. He added that Congress workers will vote for the next party president whenever organisational elections are held.</p>
<p>Following a series of meetings this week, Azad and veteran Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda (another member of the G-23), said to have discussed "concrete proposals" for "collective leadership" to strengthen the party.

       In a recent statement, the G-23 faction urged the Congress high command to "adopt the model of collective and inclusive leadership and decision making at all levels".
  
      "In order to oppose the BJP it is necessary to strengthen the Congress party. We demand the Congress party to initiate dialogue with other like-minded forces to create a platform to pave the way for a credible alternative for 2024. The next steps will be announced soon," the statement read.</p>
